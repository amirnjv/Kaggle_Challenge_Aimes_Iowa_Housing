# Analysis and Prediction of Residential Sale Prices in Ames Real Estate Project

# Estimation of Housing Sale Prices for Innovative Real Estate Development
---

This project is about a new development in Ames where old designs are being updated. The goal is to find out how much houses in the area are worth. This helps to know how much it costs to buy land and make sure everyone is paid fairly when they sell their land or house.

We will look at how the size of different parts of a house affects its price. Then, using a regression model, we will predict the prices of these houses. This will help the developers understand how much they should budget for buying properties in this area.
